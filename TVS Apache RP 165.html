			<p>TVS Company is introducing a new Bike in 2023 which is TVS-Apache-RP-165. You can select the color of your bike which you want. TVS launched its limited-edition variant for the most popular entry-level sports bike Apache in India. The TVS Apache RP 165 was launched with a lot of technical & cosmetic upgrades over the standard Apache 160. The limited-edition Apache RTR 165 RP was TVS’ debut product from their Racing Performance series of motorcycles. It was launched with a premium ex-showroom price starting from Rs. 1 40,000 lakh, and it came powered by a newly-developed 164.9 cc engine. The paint scheme was also unique to the motorcycle, which would remind you of the TVS Apache RR 310 BTO Series. Only 200 units of these unique motorcycles were on sale in India.

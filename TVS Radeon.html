			<p>TVS Company is introducing a new Bike in 2023 which is TVS-Radeon. You can select the color of your bike which you want. TVS Radeon is a mileage bike available in 3 variants and 7 colours. The TVS Radeon is powered by 109.7cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 8.08 bhp and a torque of 8.7 Nm. With both front and rear drum brakes, TVS Radeon comes up with combined braking system of both wheels. This Radeon bike weighs 113 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 10 liters. The Radeon’s engine displaces nearly 110cc. This air-cooled single-cylinder, fuel-injected motor generates 8.08bhp and 8.7Nm. The BS4 carbureted motor was claimed to deliver a mileage of 69.3kpl which, TVS Radeon mileage is 65Kmpl. TVS says, is up by 15 per cent after the inclusion of fuel injection now. The brakes are drums only (except for the celebratory special edition which gets disc-drum setup) but it does have TVS’ Synchronized Braking Technology. Its features include a side stand indicator with a beeper, a USB charging port (optional) and LED DRLs.
